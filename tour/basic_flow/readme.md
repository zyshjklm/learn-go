**for**

Go has only one looping construct. the `for` loop.

the basic `for` loop looks as it does in C or Java, except that the `( )` are gone (they are not even optional) and the `{ }` are required.

you can leave the pre and post statements empty. especially, drop the semicolons: C's `while` is spelled `for` in Go.

forever: if you omit the loop condition it loop forever. 

```go
for {
  // forever loop here! do sth in each loop!
}
```
