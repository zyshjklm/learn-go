## interface

an interface type is defined by a set of methods.

a value of interface type can hold any value that implements those methods.

**interfaces are satisfied implicitly.**

a type implements an interface by implementing the methods. there is no explicit declaration of intent.

implicit interfacers decouple implementation packages from the packages that define the interfaces: neither depends on the other.
